				<h1 id="About" > Education </h1> 
				<p> Along with Maths, English and Irish, I studied Construction, Music, Business and Japanese for my Leaving Certificate. 
				I believe that this is an ideal combination of subjects to aid my learning throughout the course of my studies at NCI.
				Both Music and Construction has given me an excellent framework for the creative brain required to rival competition in the computing industry.
				Business has provided me with the fundamental knowledge, in which I believe, is a necessity for anyone entering into a career. </p> 
				<br/> 
				<h1 id="About" > Work Experience </h1>
				<p>	As I mentioned back at the home page, my father owns a Texaco station where I work.
					I only work during the weekend as between commuting to college, attending lectures, and studying, I end up with little or no time in the day. 
					At the station, I do tasks such as wash cars, fill fuel, check tyre pressures, perform oil changes, stock shelves and serve customers at the till. 
					My only other work experience was a five week placement at my primary school in Rathfeigh, back in TY. 
					I believe I am a very creative person, so who knows, maybe someday my father will be a client for a future web design project of mine. 
					His petrol station could use a little more exposure! </p>
				<br/>
				<h1 id="About" > Achievements </h1> 
				<p> My most recent achievement is without doubt passing my driving test! The freedom is simply otherwordly, and I'm sure it looks good on a CV. 
					Back in TY I did a lot of karting around Athboy, Whiteriver in Drogheada and Santry. 
					I finished 3rd overall after my first drive in the Tullyallen Karting Championship (TKC).
					I competed in the Rotax Max, Senior class, it was great fun! 
					My proudest achievement has got to be releasing my second EP under the alias 'Visor', back in 2015. 
					The small collection of songs on this EP, which was written and recorded along with my brother, means an enormous amount to me.
					A lot of time was put into these songs, and I am so fortunate that they came out the way they did. </p>
